# Piecemeal
*Collaborative food-sourcing webapp, built in Java/Springboot*

This is the public repository containing code for **Piecemeal.** Development is currently in progress.

The goal of the program is to allow houses to share grocery trips, allowing them to save money over time collaboratively.

Currently, Piecemeal is in a nonfunctional pre-alpha state. However, you are free to peruse the code for now; in the future, the master copy of Piecemeal will be hosted on my personal website, [here](https://www.starhound.dev). I hope you will keep an eye on it!
